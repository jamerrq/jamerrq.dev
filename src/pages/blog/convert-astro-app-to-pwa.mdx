A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a type of web application that is designed to
work on any platform and device, regardless of the browser or operating system
being used. PWAs are designed to be fast, reliable, and engaging, and they can
be installed on a user's device just like a native app. PWAs are built using
standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and they can be
accessed through a web browser just like any other website.

## What are the benefits of a PWA?

While PWAs are not a perfect solution for all applications, they have some
advantages that make them attractive for certain use cases:

- **Faster load times**: PWAs load quickly, even on slow connections.
- **Offline operation**: PWAs can work without an internet connection, but this
  depends on how the application logic has been implemented.
- **Automatic updates**: PWAs update automatically, which means that users will
  always have the latest version of the application without needing to download
  or install updates.
- **Lower data consumption**: PWAs consume less data than native applications,
  which can be useful for users with limited data plans.
- **Compatibility**: PWAs are compatible with most modern browsers, which means
  that users don't need to download a specific application for each platform.

## How can I convert my Astro app into a PWA?

If you already have an Astro application, converting it into a PWA is a really
simple process. In this tutorial, I'll show you how you can do it in 4 easy
steps. I will also show you how to implement this functionality in this same
page so you can see the result in action. Let's get started!

### 1.

To make your application look good on different platforms, you will need to have
a favicon in different sizes. To be more specific, you will need these sizes:

- 16x16
- 32x32
- 57x57
- 60x60
- 70x70
- 72x72
- 76x76
- 96x96
- 114x114
- 120x120
- 128x128
- 144x144
- 150x150
- 152x152
- 180x180
- 192x192
- 310x310
- 384x384
- 512x512

As you can see, you will need a lot of different sizes. But fortunately, there
is
a tool that allows you to generate all these sizes automatically, with

<a href='https://favycon.vercel.app/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>
  Favycon
</a>
you only need an image of 512x512 (or larger) and the tool will generate all the
necessary sizes for you. Make sure to check the "PWA" option so that the tool generates
the necessary sizes for a PWA. The image should preferably be in `.png` or `.svg`
format with a transparent background; if your image does not meet these requirements,
you can use tools like <a
  href='https://www.remove.bg/'
  target='_blank'
  rel='noopener'
>
  Remove.bg
</a> to remove the background from your image and <a
  href='https://squoosh.app/'
  target='_blank'
  rel='noopener'
>
  Squoosh
</a> to convert your image to `.png` or `.svg` and optimize it.

<a href='https://favycon.vercel.app/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>
  <Image src='/img/blog/favycon.png' alt='favycon' width='967' height='449' />
</a>

In the compressed file you download, you will find a folder called `icons`,
which
contains all the necessary sizes for your application. You can include this
folder directly in the `public` folder of your Astro application. You will also
find a file called `browserconfig.xml`, which I recommend moving to the root of
the `public` folder for easy access, but this is optional.

### 2. Manifest file

The next step is to create a manifest file for your application. This file tells
the browser how your application should behave when installed on a device. To
create this file, we will use a `Vite` plugin called `vite-plugin-manifest`.
This
plugin allows us to generate a manifest file from a configuration file. To
install it, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pnpm add -D vite-plugin-manifest
```

Once the plugin is installed, you will need to create a configuration file for
the plugin. You can call this file whatever you want, for example, in my case, I
have created a file `seoConfig.ts` where I will include the manifest
configuration. Here's an example of what this file might look like, where I also
include the SEO configuration for my application:

**`seoConfig.ts`**

```typescript
import type { ManifestOptions } from 'vite-plugin-pwa'

/**
 * Configuración de SEO para la aplicación.
 * SEO configuration for the application.
 */
export const seoConfig = {
  baseURL: 'https://jamerrq.deno.dev/', // Production URL.
  description:
    'Desarrollador de software con experiencia en desarrollo web y aplicaciones backend.',
  type: 'website',
  image: {
    url: 'https://jamerrq.deno.dev/og-image2.png',
    alt: 'jamerrq.dev',
    width: 730,
    height: 382
  },
  siteName: 'jamerrq.dev',
  twitter: {
    card: 'summary_large_image'
  }
}

/**
 * Configuración del manifiesto para la aplicación.
 * Defines the configuration for PWA webmanifest.
 */
export const manifest: Partial<ManifestOptions> = {
  name: 'jamerrq.dev',
  short_name: 'jamerrq.dev',
  description:
    'Desarrollador de software con experiencia en desarrollo web y aplicaciones backend.',
  theme_color: '#0F0F0F',
  background_color: '#0F0F0F',
  display: 'fullscreen',
  icons: [
    {
      src: '/img/icons/favicon-192x192.png',
      sizes: '192x192',
      type: 'image/png'
    },
    {
      src: '/img/icons/favicon-512x512.png',
      sizes: '512x512',
      type: 'image/png'
    },
    {
      src: '/img/icons/favicon-512x512.png',
      sizes: '512x512',
      type: 'image/png',
      purpose: 'any maskable'
    }
  ]
}
```

Make sure the `img` folder is at the root of your project and contains the icons
you generated with `Favycon`. If you have followed the previous steps, your
`img`
folder should contain the necessary icons for your application.

### 3. Metadata tags

The next step is to include the necessary metadata tags in the `layout.astro`
file of your application. These tags will help search engines index your
application and display it correctly in search results. Below is an example of
how you can include these tags in your `layout.astro` file:

**`layout.astro`**

```html
<!-- PWA Support -->

<!-- Favicons. -->
<!-- 16 -->
<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/png"
  sizes="16x16"
  href="/img/icons/favicon-16x16.png"
/>
<!-- 20 -->
<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/png"
  sizes="20x20"
  href="/img/icons/favicon-20x20.png"
/>
<!-- 24 -->
<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/png"
  sizes="24x24"
  href="/img/icons/favicon-24x24.png"
/>
<!-- 48 -->
<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/png"
  sizes="48x48"
  href="/img/icons/favicon-48x48.png"
/>
<!-- 64 -->
<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/png"
  sizes="64x64"
  href="/img/icons/favicon-64x64.png"
/>
<!-- 128 -->
<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/png"
  sizes="128x128"
  href="/img/icons/favicon-128x128.png"
/>
<!-- 144 -->
<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/png"
  sizes="144x144"
  href="/img/icons/favicon-144x144.png"
/>
<!-- 256 -->
<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/png"
  sizes="256x256"
  href="/img/icons/favicon-256x256.png"
/>
<!-- 512 -->
<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/png"
  sizes="512x512"
  href="/img/icons/favicon-512x512.png"
/>
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/img/icons/favicon.ico" />

<!-- Sitemap -->
<meta name="msapplication-config" content="/browserconfig.xml" />

<!-- Worker Registration -->
{ !import.meta.env.DEV && (
<script is:inline src="/registerSW.js"></script>
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest" />
) }
```

In this example, I have included the necessary tags for the favicons and the
manifest file. I have also included a `registerSW.js` file that registers the
Service Worker in the application. This file is necessary for the application to
work correctly as a PWA once it has been built.

### 4. Vite configuration for Astro

The last step is to configure Vite to include the manifest file in the `public`
folder of your application. To do this, you will need to modify the Astro
configuration to include the `vite-plugin-manifest` plugin that will do the work
for you. Below is an example of how you can do this:

**`astro.config.ts`** (or `astro.config.{mjs,js}`)

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  // ... other config
  vite: {
    plugins: [
      VitePWA({
        registerType: 'autoUpdate',
        manifest,
        workbox: {
          globDirectory: 'dist',
          globPatterns: [
            '**/*.{js,css,svg,png,jpg,jpeg,gif,webp,woff,woff2,ttf,eot,ico}'
          ],
          // Don't fallback on document based (e.g. `/some-page`) requests
          // This removes an errant console.log message from showing up.
          navigateFallback: null
        }
      })
    ]
  }
  // ... other config
})
```

With this, you will have your Astro application configured as a PWA. Now, when
you build your application, Vite will generate a manifest file and a Service
Worker that will allow you to install your application on your device.

## Bonus: Lumina

`Lumina` is an open-source template that I created to help you create Astro
applications with support for PWA, SEO, and other features. If you want to
create
an Astro application with PWA support, I recommend trying `Lumina`. You can find
more information about `Lumina` in its <a
href="https://github.com/jamerrq/lumina"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repository</a> or directly on its <a
href="https://lumina-sigma.vercel.app/" target="_blank"
rel="noopener">website</a>.
